# Virtual Environment Configuration
# 
# Defines configuration for virtstrap and
# can be used for other collaborating
# programs. Virtstrap will ignore most
# of the config because it is only truly 
# concerned with the package name and the 
# install section. You can have multiple 
# install sections using install:[name].
